Abstract: In 1987, Jim Gray and Gianfranco Putzolu introduced the five-minute rule, a
simple, storage-memory-economics-based heuristic for deciding when data should
live in DRAM rather than on storage. Subsequent revisits to the rule largely
retained that economics-only view, leaving host costs, feasibility limits, and
workload behavior out of scope. This paper revisits the rule from first
principles, integrating host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and
physics-grounded models of SSD performance and cost, and then embedding these
elements in a constraint- and workload-aware framework that yields actionable
provisioning guidance. We show that, for modern AI platforms, especially
GPU-centric hosts paired with ultra-high-IOPS SSDs engineered for fine-grained
random access, the DRAM-to-flash caching threshold collapses from minutes to a
few seconds. This shift reframes NAND flash memory as an active data tier and
exposes a broad research space across the hardware-software stack. We further
introduce MQSim-Next, a calibrated SSD simulator that supports validation and
sensitivity analysis and facilitates future architectural and system research.
Finally, we present two concrete case studies that showcase the software system
design space opened by such memory hierarchy paradigm shift. Overall, we turn a
classical heuristic into an actionable, feasibility-aware analysis and
provisioning framework and set the stage for further research on AI-era memory
hierarchy.

Abstract: This paper presents a 3D-stacked chiplets based large language model (LLM)
inference accelerator, consisting of non-volatile in-memory-computing
processing elements (PEs) and Inter-PE Computational Network (IPCN),
interconnected via silicon photonic to effectively address the communication
bottlenecks. A LLM mapping scheme was developed to optimize hardware scheduling
and workload mapping. Simulation results show it achieves $3.95\times$ speedup
and $30\times$ efficiency improvement over the Nvidia A100 before chiplet
clustering and power gating scheme (CCPG). Additionally, the system achieves
further scalability and efficiency improvement with the implementation of CCPG
to accommodate larger models, attaining $57\times$ efficiency improvement over
Nvidia H100 at similar throughput.

Abstract: Hardware disaggregation seeks to transform Data Center (DC) resources from
traditional server fleets into unified resource pools. Despite existing
challenges that may hinder its full realization, significant progress has been
made in both industry and academia. In this article, we provide an overview of
the motivations and recent advancements in hardware disaggregation. We further
discuss the research challenges and opportunities associated with disaggregated
architectures, focusing on aspects that have received limited attention. We
argue that hardware disaggregation has the potential to reshape the entire DC
ecosystem, impacting application design, resource scheduling, hardware
configuration, cooling, and power system optimization. Additionally, we present
a numerical study to illustrate several key aspects of these challenges.

Motivation: 随着SRAM存内计算追求更高性能，复杂电路设计和高工作频率加剧了IR-drop问题，传统电路级解决方案会牺牲PPA（功耗、性能、面积）指标

Method: 提出AIM软硬件协同设计框架：包括Rtog和HR建立工作负载与IR-drop的关联、LHR和WDS软件优化、IR-Booster动态调整机制、HR感知的任务映射方法

Result: 在7nm 256-TOPS PIM芯片上的后仿真结果显示，AIM实现了69.2%的IR-drop缓解，2.29倍能效提升和1.152倍加速比

Conclusion: AIM通过架构级的软硬件协同设计有效解决了高性能存内计算中的IR-drop问题，在保持计算精度的同时显著提升了能效和性能

Abstract: SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising
implementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density,
energy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher
performance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating
frequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly
degrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional
circuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are
resource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To
address these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware
co-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.
Initially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties
of PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between
PIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,
enabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while
maintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,
we develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates
software-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt
the V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and
performance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging
software and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout
simulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up
to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement
and 1.152x speedup.

Abstract: The rapid growth of data-intensive applications such as generative AI,
scientific simulations, and large-scale analytics is driving modern
supercomputers and data centers toward increasingly heterogeneous and tightly
integrated architectures. These systems combine powerful CPUs and accelerators
with emerging high-bandwidth memory and storage technologies to reduce data
movement and improve computational efficiency. However, as the number of
accelerators per node increases, communication bottlenecks emerge both within
and between nodes, particularly when network resources are shared among
heterogeneous components.
