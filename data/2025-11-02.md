Abstract: Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep
up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive
applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models.
Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by
integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and
accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but
existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address
this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework
designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM
concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network
contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook.
Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond
granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with
homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate
the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal
analysis capability.

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement
bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized
dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and
strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail
to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between
theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical
hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to
accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By
jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and
CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space
to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results
demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to
$3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.
