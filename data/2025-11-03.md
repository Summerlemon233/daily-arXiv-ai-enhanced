Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of timing closure challenges and
constraints in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs). We examine core timing principles, architectural
distinctions, and design methodologies influencing timing behavior in both
technologies. A case study comparing the Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGA
(XCKU040) with a 7nm ASIC highlights practical timing analysis and performance
trade-offs. Experimental results show ASICs achieve superior timing of 45ps
setup and 35ps hold, while modern FPGAs remain competitive with 180ps setup and
120ps hold times, validating their suitability for high-performance designs.

Abstract: The security and efficiency of modern computing systems are fundamentally
undermined by the absence of a native architectural mechanism to propagate
high-level program semantics, such as object identity, bounds, and lifetime,
across the hardware/software interface. This paper presents a comprehensive
survey of the architectural paradigm designed to bridge this semantic gap:
descriptor-based, object-aware memory systems. By elevating the descriptor to a
first-class architectural abstraction, this paradigm enables hardware to
dynamically acquire and enforce the rich semantics of software-defined objects.
This survey systematically charts the evolution and current landscape of this
approach. We establish the foundational concepts of memory objects and
descriptors and introduce a novel taxonomy of descriptor addressing modes,
providing a structured framework for analyzing and comparing diverse
implementations. Our unified analysis reveals how this paradigm holistically
addresses the intertwined challenges of memory protection, management, and
processing. As a culminating case study, we re-examine the CentroID model,
demonstrating how its hybrid tagged-pointer encoding and descriptor processing
mechanisms embody the path toward practical and efficient object-aware designs.
Finally, we outline how the explicit cross-layer communication of object
semantics provides a foundational research direction for next-generation cache
hierarchies, unified virtual memory, and even 128-bit architectures.
